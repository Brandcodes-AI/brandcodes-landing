1. Core design principles (non-negotiables)

These should guide every decision.

1. Motion serves understanding

Every animation must answer “what does BrandCodes do?”

No decorative motion without a functional metaphor (scan, assemble, route, resolve)

2. QR = infrastructure, not art

Stylized QR appears only when paired with:

“GS1-compliant”

“Production-ready”

“Dynamic Digital Link”

Art QR is always positioned as powered by standards, never replacing them

3. One code, many contexts (repeated everywhere)

This idea should appear:

Visually (routing paths, color-coded flows)

Verbally (microcopy, captions)

Structurally (page layout progression)

2. Color system (refined & scoped)
Primary system (default)

Electric blue + deep navy + off-white

Used for:

Hero

Platform sections

Pricing

GS1 / trust

Accent system (controlled)

Neon green

Used only for:

Scanner line effects

Active states

Primary CTA hover

Never used as background fills

Industry system (section-scoped)

Amber / orange

Used in:

Use case sections

Packaging imagery frames

Case study highlights

Never leaks into platform or pricing sections

3. Page architecture (section by section)
1️⃣ Hero — “Dynamic QR, grounded in standards”

Visual

Central QR with:

Static, high-contrast scannable core

Subtle outer pulse / pattern shift on hover

Mouse movement changes persona label:

9️⃣ CTA — scan glow, but disciplined

Primary CTA

Talk to us

Interaction

Single neon scan line sweep on hover

No pulsing, no looping

4. Motion & interaction rules (hard limits)

Max 1 animated element per viewport

No continuous loops above the fold

All animations:

150–300ms

Ease-out

QR always remains visibly scannable

5. Copy & tone guardrails

Prefer:
